This is for my friends who i've told to watch Ted Lasso and still haven't.  
Read this if you want all the banger quotes I could find and why they matter.

*SPOLIERS AHEAD (maybe im not really sure) PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK*

From the start, Ted Lasso is set up to fail. He’s a former coach of an amateur American football team, known for leading them to success, but he’s suddenly hired by an English Premier League club to coach a sport he knows nothing about — soccer, or as the locals call it, "football."

But what they don’t account for is Ted Lasso himself. His relentless optimism and genuine effort to win over both the team and the town prove stronger than any doubts or schemes. Even those who hired him with the hope of sabotaging the team for personal revenge are taken by surprise.

The best way to understand why Ted is so exceptional isn’t through an explanation. His quotes speak volumes about who he is and what makes him truly unforgettable.

- "Do you believe in ghosts, Ted? I do, but more importantly I think they need to believe in themselves." 

- "Fairytales do not start, nor do they end, in the dark forest"

- "The truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off."

- "Be a goldfish

- "You know what the happiest animal on Earth is? It’s a goldfish. You know why? Got a 10-second memory. Be a goldfish, Sam." <- Just to follow up the last one

- "He thinks he's mad now, wait till we win him over. He'll be furious."

- "Taking on a challenge is a lot like riding a horse. If you’re comfortable while you’re doing it, you’re probably doing it wrong."

- "Every day is a chance to be better than we were the day before."

- "There’s two buttons I never like hittin’, and that’s panic and snooze."
