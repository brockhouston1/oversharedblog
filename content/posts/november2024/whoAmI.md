*For those of you who dont know me... and are curious.*
<!--more-->
- I dream of giving my loved ones everything they need and want
- I strive for excellence in everything I do
- I draw motivation from anime and anger more than I probably should
- I feel the constant pressure of time slipping away, never enough hours to pursue all my ambitions
- I yearn for deeper human connections, working in solitude now to enable meaningful relationships later
- I find solace and inspiration in music
- I find joy skating with my friends
- I aspire to be **fiercely faithful**

What does it mean to be **fiercely faithful**?

___

**Ferocity**: the state of being ferocious, which can mean either:

- "exhibiting unrestrained violence and brutality" or
- "extremely intense"

*(We'll go with the second definition.)*

**Faithfulness**: can be defined as:

- "firm belief in something for which there is no proof" or
- "complete trust"

I gravitate toward the first definition, particularly because it challenges the rational mindset I once desperately wanted to embody.

## **The Formula:**

Ferocity + Faith = ?This gives us either:

- An extremely intense belief in something without proof
- Or an extremely intense complete trust

Why am I sharing this?

If you're reading this, you're likely an entrepreneur or someone with a vision—even if that vision isn't fully clear yet. The entrepreneurial journey often feels like stepping onto a battlefield, armed only with self-doubt and bombarded by social media "success stories" of teenage entrepreneurs flashing their $50,000 MRR screenshots, promising you can "do it too" if you just buy their no-code SaaS course.

But this isn't about:

- Selling you a course
- Showcasing my productivity habits
- Demonstrating perfect grammar

This is about solving a personal quest: finding others who are fiercely faithful in themselves and their creations. I'm seeking kindred spirits who don't flinch when declaring ambitious goals—whether it's reaching a net worth of $500,000,000 by 30, 40, 50, 60, or 70.

The world needs more people who are fiercely faithful. People who believe so intensely in their vision that doubt becomes background noise. People who trust their path even when they can't see the entire road ahead.

Being fiercely faithful isn't about blind optimism—it's about having the courage to believe in yourself when logic says you shouldn't. It's about maintaining that fire in your belly even when others call you crazy. It's about waking up every day and choosing to trust your journey, especially on the days when it feels impossible.

I'm not looking for people who have it all figured out. I'm looking for the dreamers, the builders, the ones who feel that burning in their chest when they think about their goals. The ones who understand that being fiercely faithful isn't just a mindset—it's a way of life.

So here's my invitation: If you're fiercely faithful, or aspiring to be, let's connect. Let's build. Let's prove that unwavering belief, combined with relentless action, can turn the impossible into reality.

```
Because at the end of the day, the world doesn't remember those who played it safe.
It remembers those who were fiercely faithful.
```
