<h1>Programming Competition</h1>

Nov. 11, 2024


<br/><br/>
<p>There’s just more horsepower under the hood for some people and that is okay lol.</p>
<p>I went on a trip with my schools computer science club (SOCS) up to Provo and Salt Lake.
First I want to say that it was super fun and I am really glad I went.</p>
<p>It started on Thursday when we all drove up in two vans from STG to Provo. We played a fun game called Red Flags and It was super cool to be able to hangout with everybody including the professors in a different setting.</p>
<p>Friday we all got up and took two trains to the University of Utah. Ren (one of the professors) hooked us up with a tour led by the networking graduate program. That was super cool to see, I didn’t even know you could be research staff for a university as a job.</p>
<p>After that we had the practice comp… Julia Paula and I solved one of the problems and got everything situated. Honestly though the highlight of that day was getting frosties from Wendy’s with Ren, Jayson, Kyleigh, Julia, and Paula. The next morning we woke up and drove to BYU for the comp.</p>
<p>Within minutes of opening the packet for the problems one of the teams solved the first one. I’m not exaggerating, they literally solved it in two minutes. We got that one a bit later. Paula and I were working on a particular problem together and we actually made a really great team. We both have different strengths that work together really well when we both make an effort to stay on the same team in a stressful situation.</p>
<p>Sadly no more than 2 problems were solved by Global Variables (Paula, Julia, and I). We almost got a 3rd but, ran out of time. We ended up in 43rd place I think out of 54 teams. Not bad! Also not great lol.</p>
<p>Now I’m not saying this to discredit the value in working consistently on a skill but after being at that competition and being around really smart people I think I have realized that some peoples ovens burn a little hotter and thats okay. A lot of the time though, I think those who are gifted with natural talent get a little lazy and rest while the tortoise slowly inches past. Just gotta make sure to continue to chug a long I guess.</p>
