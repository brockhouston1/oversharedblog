<h1>If They Succeed, You Succeed.</h1>

Nov. 6, 2024


<br/><br/>
<p>I have been way too selfish for way too long..</p>
<p>The other morning I started listening to a Russel Brunson book (if you don&rsquo;t
know who he is I highly reccomend you look him up). The books name is &ldquo;Traffic
Secrets&rdquo; and in the foreward of the book it says this&hellip;</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&#34;I didn’t really get to know Russell until a few years later, but when I did,  
I realized he was one of the most humble, smart, ambitious, energetic, and authentic human   
beings I’d ever met.

What most impressed me was how he talked about helping entrepreneurs grow faster.  
He talked about them as if they were his children, and with an authentic excitement.  

That’s very rare in our world today. 

Russell’s focus was never on how much money he was going to make or how big his business was going to be.  
He always looked through the lens of how to help people go faster.  

He took that energy and passion and cofounded a company called ClickFunnels, which has revolutionized  
the way people use the internet to turn their ideas into sellable products and services. Russell has truly  
given people a faster way to make an impact and profit from their ideas. 

Russell’s passion drove ClickFunnels to become one of the fastest-growing software as a service (SaaS)  
companies of all time&#34;
</code></pre><p><strong>I LOVE this line</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;What most impressed me was how he talked about helping entrepreneurs grow
faster. He talked about them as if they were his children, and with an
authentic excitement.&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>(His company is worth around $400,000,000 btw)</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time I have heard of someones success being attributed to
having a strong desire to help others. The essence of entrepreneurship is to
find problems that need fixing and innovating in a way that fixes that problem.
I sometimes forget that and instantly think of schemy ways to make some quick
cash, but I think that I am learning that isn&rsquo;t where the real wealth of money
or life hides.</p>
<p>I really hope that someday someone would feel the need or desire to write
a foreword like that about me. I&rsquo;m going to start pulling my motivation from
the the view that I am helping people. Giving them more time with their family
and bringing more money into their bank accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Even if it&rsquo;s not as noble as building schools in Guatamala, I think it is still
worth doing.</strong></p>
